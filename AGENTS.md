## Project Overview

guard-core-rs is the Rust port of the [guard-core](https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core) detection engine: the framework-agnostic, CPU-bound core of the Guard ecosystem. It is a cargo workspace of five crates that currently implements content preprocessing, semantic analysis, and regex pattern compilation, plus a spec conformance harness. It is a pre-1.0 work in progress: several pipeline stages (most notably the 4.x pattern-table scan stage) and all I/O layers are not yet ported. Do not claim parity with the Python engine in any doc, issue, or PR.

- **Repository**: https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core-rs
- **Language**: Rust, edition 2024, MSRV 1.92
- **License**: MIT OR Apache-2.0
- **Version**: 0.0.1 (pre-release; API surface unstable)
- **Reference implementation**: guard-core (Python), spec 4.0.2
- **Status**: work in progress. Read [Current Status](#current-status) before writing any code or docs here.

## Ecosystem Position

```
guard-core (Python)           <- Reference implementation, spec owner (specs/01-14), corpus source
├── guard-core-rs (this repo) <- Rust port: detection engine + conformance harness
│   ├── tower-guard-rs        <- Adapter (scaffold)
│   ├── axum-guard-rs         <- Adapter (scaffold)
│   ├── actix-guard-rs        <- Adapter (scaffold)
│   └── rocket-guard-rs       <- Adapter (scaffold)
├── guard-core-go             <- Go port (precedent for the conformance layout)
└── guard-core-ts             <- TypeScript port
```

Per `specs/impl/rs.md` in the reference repo, the engine crate serves two consumers:

1. **Native Rust middleware**: the engine behind the four adapter crates (all currently scaffolds).
2. **Embeddable engine**: PyO3 bindings (`guard-core-python`) exposing the detection sections to Python. The binding surface mirrors only the detection sections (04-06); it is NOT a guard-core replacement and MUST NOT be documented as one.

Ports target **spec 4.0.2**. The conformance corpus is vendored byte-identical from the reference repo with a sha256 manifest, so every behavioral claim can be checked against a pinned, shared fixture set.

## Boundary Rules

- **`guard-core-engine` MUST stay framework-free and I/O-free**: no network, no filesystem access at runtime, no tokio, no async runtime, no framework crates (actix-web, axum, rocket, tower, hyper). Pure, synchronous, CPU-bound functions only.
- **No panics across the FFI boundary or the public API**: engine malfunctions return typed errors; the fail-closed rule of the reference repo's `conformance.md` applies.
- **`guard-core-python` (PyO3) exposes detection sections 04-06 only** (`04-detection`, `05-content-pipeline`, `06-suspatterns` in the reference repo's `specs/`). Handlers, config, Redis, IP intelligence, rate limiting, and responses are out of scope. Publish only in lockstep with the engine crate (PyO3 ABI coupling).
- **`guard-core-rs` (facade crate)** is the planned home for config (section 02), pipeline (section 03), and handlers (sections 07-12) behind `async_trait`. Today it only re-exports the engine modules (`compiler`, `preprocessor`, `semantic`).
- **Adapter crates wire framework types to the engine and contain no security logic.**
- **Never edit files under `conformance/guard-core-spec-4.0.2/`**: the corpus is vendored byte-identical from the reference repo and protected by a sha256 manifest in `CORPUS.md`. Behavior changes happen in the engine, not the fixtures.

## Current Status

Honest state of the port. Verify rather than trust; numbers below were read from the repo (corpus `index.json`, `conformance/xfail_baseline.toml`, crate sources).

### Implemented (guard-core-engine)

- **`compiler`**: regex compilation with `(?im)` flags, LRU-backed `PatternCache` (capacity clamped to 1..=5000), `validate_pattern_safety` (ReDoS-construct deny list), `batch_compile`. 7 inline tests.
- **`preprocessor`**: NFKC normalization with lookalike folding, whitespace collapsing, null-byte removal, a 7-round decoding pipeline (URL decoding, HTML entities, `\xNN`, `\uNNNN`, base64 candidates behind a printable-ASCII gate, SQL comment stripping), attack-region extraction, attack-preserving truncation. 14 inline tests.
- **`semantic`**: token extraction, Shannon entropy, encoding-layer detection, attack probability scoring, obfuscation detection, code-injection risk, aggregate threat scoring. 14 inline tests.
- **`guard-core-python`**: 10 PyO3 functions (`preprocess`, `normalize_unicode`, `decode_common_encodings`, `analyze`, `get_threat_score`, `calculate_entropy`, `detect_encoding_layers`, `detect_obfuscation`, `validate_pattern_safety`, `batch_threat_scores` with the GIL released). Functions only, no classes.
- **`guard-core-benchmark`**: 4 criterion suites (`compiler`, `detection_engine`, `preprocessor`, `semantic`).
- **CI**: format check, clippy with `-D warnings`, workspace tests, MSRV 1.92 job, `cargo audit`, `cargo deny`, docs build with warnings as errors, libfuzzer smoke, conformance gate.

### Conformance (on the `feat/conformance-ledger` branch, pending merge to master)

- Vendored spec 4.0.2 corpus: **163 cases across 11 suites** (xss 22, sqli 22, cmd_injection 18, path_traversal 10, inclusion_sensitive_recon 18, misc_injection 29, encoding 8, semantic 6, benign 15, context_matrix 9, boundaries 6), pinned at reference commit `886f8013`.
- **Pattern translation ledger** (`conformance/pattern_ledger.toml`): 70 patterns (47 as-is, 3 translated, 20 residual). Every corpus pattern must compile as-is or have a recorded, corpus-verified translation; anything else fails CI. Translated entries are currently all `\Z` to `\z` anchor rewrites.
- **xfail baseline** (`conformance/xfail_baseline.toml`): 124 baselined cases. With zero drift the gate reports **39 passed / 124 xfail** (163 total). xfail reasons: 119 x "rust engine lacks the 4.x pattern-table scan stage", plus a handful of documented preprocessor divergences.
- Drift handling is **fail-closed**: an unbaselined failure fails the gate, a baselined-but-passing (stale) xfail fails the gate, and an unbaselined not-run case fails the gate.

### Not yet implemented

- **The 4.x pattern-table scan stage**: the full reference regex pattern table across the scan views (processed / raw / decoded-path-traversal / url-decoded / short-base64) has no Rust counterpart. The conformance detect equivalent therefore hardcodes `regex_anomaly = 0.0` and relies on semantic analysis only; this is the dominant cause of the 124 xfail entries.
- Config, pipeline, and handler sections (02, 03, 07-12): no handlers, protocols, decorators, or I/O layers exist in Rust.
- `PerformanceMonitor`, per-scan timeout, tracked-pattern knobs (5 detection knobs are recorded as unmapped with reasons).
- Open decision, deliberately not settled: ledger-only (stdlib `regex`) vs ledger plus `fancy-regex` for the 20 residual patterns.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core-rs
cd guard-core-rs
cargo build --workspace --exclude guard-core-python
cargo test --workspace --exclude guard-core-python
```

Using the facade crate (from the `guard-core-rs` doctest; API is unstable at 0.0.1):

```rust
use guard_core_rs::preprocessor;
use guard_core_rs::semantic::{self, AttackKeywords, AttackStructures};

let raw = "<scr\u{200B}ipt>alert(1)</script>";
let clean = preprocessor::preprocess(raw, 10_000, true);

let result = semantic::analyze(&clean, &AttackKeywords::default(), &AttackStructures::default());
let score = semantic::get_threat_score(&result);
assert!(score > 0.0);
```

There is no checked-in Python packaging config for `guard-core-python` yet (PyO3 cdylib, `abi3-py310`); it is currently exercised from source, not from a published wheel.

## Development Commands

There is no Makefile or justfile. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` are the source of truth; every command below is copied from them.
```bash
# Documentation site (docs.yml builds strict and deploys on master)
pip install mkdocs-material && mkdocs build --strict

# Example apps (workspace members; see examples/*/README.md for the full smoke assertions)
cargo build -p guard-core-rs-simple-app -p guard-core-rs-advanced-app
docker compose -f examples/simple_app/docker-compose.yml up --build -d --wait
docker compose -f examples/advanced_app/docker-compose.yml up --build -d --wait
```


```bash
# Format check (CI gate)
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Lint (CI gate; clippy::all is deny, nursery + pedantic are warn)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --exclude guard-core-python -- -D warnings

# Unit + integration tests (CI gate)
cargo test --workspace --exclude guard-core-python

# Conformance gate (spec 4.0.2); prints "conformance gate: N passed, N failed, N xfail, N not_run"
cargo test -p guard-core-conformance --test conformance -- --nocapture

# Ledger integrity: every corpus pattern is as-is, translated, or residual, exactly one state
cargo test -p guard-core-conformance --test ledger_integrity -- --nocapture

# Docs build with warnings as errors (CI gate)
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --exclude guard-core-python --no-deps --all-features

# MSRV check (CI runs this on toolchain 1.92.0)
cargo check --workspace --exclude guard-core-python --all-targets

# Supply-chain (CI gate)
cargo audit
cargo deny check

# Benchmarks (criterion)
cargo bench -p guard-core-benchmark

# Fuzz smoke (requires nightly; three targets: fuzz_preprocess, fuzz_semantic, fuzz_compiler)
cargo +nightly fuzz build
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_preprocess -- -max_total_time=60
```

`guard-core-python` is excluded from the clippy/test/doc jobs because it is a PyO3 `extension-module` cdylib; note that no CI job currently compiles it. Pre-commit (`pre-commit run --all-files`) runs rustfmt, clippy autofix, tests, zizmor, prettier, taplo, and a pygrep hook that forbids outer `#[allow(...)]` attributes outside tests and fuzz code.

Note: `guard-core-conformance` and the root `conformance/` directory live on the `feat/conformance-ledger` branch until it merges.

## Actions

The workflow set mirrors the engine-class standard (guard-core-go): `ci.yml` (fmt/clippy/test, MSRV, security audit, rustdoc), `fuzz.yml`, `live-smoke.yml` (dockerized compose runs of both example apps with curl assertions of real engine behavior), `docs.yml` (mkdocs-material strict build + gh-deploy to Pages on master), `ecosystem-gate.yml` (matrix over the four Rust adapters, each tested against this engine master via the sibling path-dependency override), `release.yml` (v* tag gate: fmt/clippy/test on stable + MSRV 1.92, conformance gate, tag/version consistency; publishing is manual and owner-gated), plus the community set (`greetings.yml`, `issue-link.yml`, `labeler.yml`, `stale.yml`, `summary.yml`, `sync-labels.yml`). All third-party actions are SHA-pinned.

## Technology Stack

- **Rust**: edition 2024, MSRV 1.92, toolchain channel `stable` with clippy + rustfmt components.
- **Engine dependencies** (workspace-pinned): `regex 1.12.4` (RE2-like, linear time, no backtracking), `lru 0.18.0`, `html-escape 0.2.13`, `percent-encoding 2.3.2`, `unicode-normalization 0.1.25`.
- **Conformance dependencies**: `serde 1.0.228`, `serde_json 1.0.145`, `toml 0.9.11`.
- **Bindings**: `pyo3 0.29.0` with `extension-module` and `abi3-py310` (Python 3.10+ ABI).
- **Benchmarks**: `criterion 0.8.2` (default features off). **Fuzzing**: `libfuzzer-sys 0.4` on nightly.
- **Supply chain**: `cargo-audit`, `cargo-deny` (license allow-list, yanked = deny, unknown sources = deny), SHA-pinned GitHub Actions (via `scripts/pin-actions.sh`).

The RE2-like `regex` crate is a structural advantage: section 04's catastrophic-backtracking class is absent, so the ReDoS arbiter reduces mostly to `validate_pattern_safety`. The cost is that corpus patterns using lookaround or backreferences need ledger translations.

## Testing & Conformance

- **Unit tests**: 55 inline `#[test]` functions (engine: compiler 7, preprocessor 14, semantic 14; conformance: 20), plus 1 doctest in the facade crate. All tests are inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules; there is no shared test-utility crate.
- **Conformance gate**: runs every corpus case through the Rust detect equivalent (preprocess, then semantic analysis under recorded config knobs), compares `is_threat`, `threat_score` (floats rounded to 6 decimals), `original_length` and `processed_length` (code-point counts), `detection_method`, and `threats` as an order-insensitive multiset. `execution_time` is dropped. The authoritative result is the printed line `conformance gate: N passed, N failed, N xfail, N not_run (spec 4.0.2)`.
- **Knob mapping**: 5 detection knobs are mapped (`detection_max_content_length`, `detection_max_body_inspect_bytes`, `detection_preserve_attack_patterns`, `detection_semantic_threshold`, `detection_threat_score_threshold`); 7 are recorded as unmapped with reasons (e.g. `PerformanceMonitor is not ported`).
- **Ledger integrity tests**: full coverage, exactly-one-state per pattern, as-is compilation, translated patterns reproducing corpus evidence, residual rejection.
- **Positions are Unicode code-point indices**, not byte offsets, in all public results and bindings (the engine matches on bytes internally and converts). Keep it that way; the corpus expects Python `match.start()` semantics on `str`.
- **Benchmarks**: `cargo bench -p guard-core-benchmark`; `scripts/benches/bench.py` compares the Rust engine against the Python `guard_core.detection_engine` (recorded results in `scripts/benches/BENCHMARKS.md`).
- **Fuzzing**: three libfuzzer targets feed arbitrary strings into `preprocess`, semantic analysis, and `compile`, asserting no panics.

## Code Quality Standards

- **Lints** (declared per crate in `[lints]`): `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, `clippy::all = "deny"`, `clippy::nursery = "warn"`, `clippy::pedantic = "warn"`. Allowed: `cast_possible_truncation`, `cast_precision_loss`, `missing_errors_doc`, `missing_panics_doc`, `module_name_repetitions`.
- **Formatting**: `rustfmt.toml` sets max width 100, `imports_granularity = "Item"`, `group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"`, doc-comment formatting and comment wrapping on. `clippy.toml` mirrors the thresholds.
- **Docs**: rustdoc warnings are errors in CI (`RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`).
- **No outer `#[allow(...)]`** in non-test, non-fuzz code; a pre-commit pygrep hook rejects it.
- **cargo-deny**: licenses limited to MIT, Apache-2.0 (incl. LLVM-exception variant), BSD-3-Clause, ISC, Unicode-3.0, Zlib; yanked crates denied; wildcard versions denied; unknown registries/git sources denied.
- **GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned**; run `scripts/pin-actions.sh` after editing workflows.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep the engine pure**: CPU-bound, synchronous, no I/O, no tokio. If a change needs I/O or async, it belongs in the facade crate or an adapter, behind the boundary rules above.
2. **Run the gates before committing**: fmt, clippy, tests (pre-commit runs them for you). Match the CI commands exactly, including `--exclude guard-core-python`.
3. **Conformance honesty**: an engine change that flips a corpus case must come with a ledger or xfail update and a written reason. Never weaken the gate; it is fail-closed by design (stale xfails fail too).
4. **Never edit the vendored corpus**; behavior changes go in the engine. Re-vendoring is a deliberate act that updates `CORPUS.md` and its sha256 manifest.
5. **Code-point positions, not byte offsets**, in every public result, binding, and comparison.
6. **Keep the CHANGELOG's "Known differences from Python" section current** when introducing a divergence (entropy over bytes, context-window widths, base64 detector breadth, etc.).
7. **Use conventional commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`), matching existing history. No AI attribution in commit messages.
8. **Document status honestly**: this is a 0.0.1 port. Say what exists and what does not; never imply parity with the Python engine.
