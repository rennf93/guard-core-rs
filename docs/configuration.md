# Configuration

There is no global config struct yet (the Python `SecurityConfig` section is
not ported). Detection is tuned through one flat struct,
`guard_core_rs::detect::DetectConfig`, passed to every `detect` call, the
global IP gate through `guard_core_engine::ip_gate::IpGateConfig`, and the
stateful layer (rate limiting, dynamic bans) through
`guard_core_engine::rate_limit::RateLimitConfig` and
`guard_core_engine::ip_ban::IpBanConfig`.

## IpGateConfig (whitelist / blacklist / exempt_ips)

The global IP gate is the Rust family's minimal port of the reference
engine's global IP stage. Build it once at startup with
`IpGateConfig::new(whitelist, blacklist, exempt_ips)`, which fails closed on
an invalid entry, and evaluate request IPs with `IpGateConfig::evaluate`:

| List | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `whitelist` | Allowlist. When non-empty, every IP it does not match is denied (`IP not in whitelist`) |
| `blacklist` | Denylist, consulted when `whitelist` is empty (`IP is blacklisted`) |
| `exempt_ips` | Skip-list for known-friendly automation; sets the skip flag, never a deny path |

Matching semantics are identical for all three lists, mirroring the reference
whitelist matcher: a bare IP or a CIDR range (host bits cleared at parse
time), IPv4-mapped forms matched against their IPv4 canonical form
(`::ffff:203.0.113.7` matches `203.0.113.7` and `203.0.113.0/24`), and no
cross-family matching.

### exempt_ips vs whitelist

`exempt_ips` is noise reduction for known-friendly automation (monitoring
probes, VPN egress, a partner's server), not immunity: it is noise reduction
for known-friendly automation, not immunity; the blacklist, dynamic bans,
route rules and detection still apply. An exempt match sets the same skip
state a whitelist match sets (`IpGateDecision::is_exempt`) but never adds a
deny path of its own and never opens the whitelist gate: with a restrictive
whitelist, an exempt IP that is not itself whitelisted is still denied. The
stateful stages below (rate limiting, violation counting, dynamic bans) skip
exactly what the reference skips for a whitelist match
(`is_whitelisted || is_exempt`) and never skip penetration detection; a
stage that lands later (user-agent filter, cloud-provider blocker) must
follow the same rule.

## Rate limiting (rate_limit)

The sliding-window rate limiter mirrors the reference engine's rate
limiter in its in-memory mode (the reference falls back to this exact store
when Redis is off; the Redis-distributed mode is a follow-up).

`RateLimitConfig` carries the knobs:

| Field | Type | Default | Reference knob |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enable_rate_limiting` | `bool` | `false` | `enable_rate_limiting` |
| `rate_limit` | `u32` | `10` | `rate_limit` (requests per window, >= 1) |
| `rate_limit_window` | `u64` | `60` | `rate_limit_window` (seconds, >= 1) |
| `enable_rate_limit_auto_ban` | `bool` | `false` | `enable_rate_limit_auto_ban` |

Two deltas from the Python reference are deliberate: the engine default for
`enable_rate_limiting` is `false` (Python defaults `true`; the Rust family
pins the conservative value so enabling is an explicit act), and the config
constructor fails closed on a zero limit or window (Python's pydantic
rejects them with `ge=1`).

Counting semantics: one sliding log of request timestamps per
`(client IP, scope)`. Before a request is recorded, every timestamp at or
before `now - window` is evicted; the pre-recording count decides
(`allowed = count < rate_limit`), and the block reports
`count + 1` (the current request included), exactly the reference's
in-memory formulation. The Redis formulation (`allowed = count <= limit`
over the post-recording rank) draws the same boundary. A blocked caller
retries after the window (`Retry-After: <window seconds>`, the reference's
`429 Too many requests` shape). The window store is an LRU capped at 10 000
keys (`_MAX_TRACKED_RATE_LIMIT_KEYS`).

Scope: `check(ip, None)` is the global per-IP window (the default pipeline
tier, every endpoint sharing one budget); `check(ip, Some(path))` is the
per-endpoint window keyed by `(ip, path)` (the reference's
`endpoint_path`-keyed tier).

## Dynamic IP bans and the auto-ban engine (ip_ban)

The ban store mirrors the reference `IPBanManager` in its in-memory mode:

- `ban_ip(ip, duration, reason)` records `expiry = now + duration`; a
  duration of zero is rejected (`BanError::NonPositiveDuration`, the
  reference raises). Re-banning a live IP overwrites its record.
- Durations beyond `LOCAL_CACHE_TTL_CAP_SECONDS` (3600) are clamped to it,
  the references' local-store cap (`clampToLocalCap`, cause
  `not configured`, and the Python `TTLCache(ttl=3600)`); only the Redis
  backend honors longer bans. The default `auto_ban_duration` sits exactly
  at the cap.
- `is_banned(ip)` honors expiry with the Go boundary: an IP is banned while
  `now <= expiry`; strictly past it the entry reads unbanned and is dropped.
- The store is an LRU capped at 10 000 entries (silent overflow, the
  references' `localCacheMaxSize` / `maxsize=10000`).
- Self-ban refusal: loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1/128`) and configured
  trusted-proxy targets return `Ok(false)` and record nothing - the
  references' self-DoS guard. Trusted proxies parse fail closed
  (`IpBanManager::with_trusted_proxies`).
- IPv4-mapped addresses canonicalize to their IPv4 form before any store
  key, so `::ffff:203.0.113.7` and `203.0.113.7` share buckets, bans, and
  counters.

`IpBanConfig` carries the auto-ban knobs:

| Field | Type | Default | Reference knob |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enable_ip_banning` | `bool` | `false` | `enable_ip_banning` |
| `auto_ban_threshold` | `u32` | `10` | `auto_ban_threshold` (>= 1) |
| `auto_ban_duration` | `u64` | `3600` | `auto_ban_duration` (seconds, >= 1) |
| `threat_ban_config` | map of category to `ThreatBanEntry { threshold, duration }` | empty | `threat_ban_config` |

Category keys are validated at config time (fail closed, like
`IpGateConfig`): a key must be a pattern-table detection category or the
`rate_limit` pseudo-category (`valid_threat_categories()`), the reference's
`ALL_DETECTION_CATEGORIES | {'rate_limit'}` set. Unknown keys are rejected,
as in Python and the TypeScript port.

Violation counting and threshold resolution mirror
`_resolve_and_apply_threshold_ban` (the TypeScript `resolveThresholdBan`):
`ViolationCounters` accumulates per IP per category (LRU capped at 10 000
IPs, `_MAX_TRACKED_SUSPICIOUS_IPS`; an empty category list records
`uncategorized`), and `IpBanManager::register_violations` (or the pure
`resolve_threshold_ban`) resolves in the reference's order:

1. banning disabled: no ban (violations still count, so enabling banning
   later starts from observed history);
2. the first listed category whose `threat_ban_config` entry's threshold is
   met (`count >= threshold`) bans with that entry's duration and reason
   `"<reason>:<category>"`;
3. otherwise the flat threshold, measured against the total of all counted
   categories, bans with `auto_ban_duration` and the plain reason;
4. the self-DoS guard can refuse the resulting ban.

The rate-limit pseudo-category feeds the same engine when
`enable_rate_limit_auto_ban` is on: a rate-limit crossing counts as one
`rate_limit` violation, so `threat_ban_config["rate_limit"]` overrides and
the flat threshold backs it up (reason `rate_limit_exceeded`), exactly the
reference pipeline's behavior.

## DetectConfig

| Field | Type | Corpus default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_content_length` | `usize` | `10000` | `detection_max_content_length`: the semantic budget; the processed content is truncated to this many code points before analysis, and it bounds truncation |
| `max_full_scan_bytes` | `usize` | `262144` | `detection_max_body_inspect_bytes`: the preprocessor's full-scan cap; content beyond it is handled by the attack-preserving truncation path |
| `preserve_attack_patterns` | `bool` | `true` | `detection_preserve_attack_patterns`: keep attack-relevant regions intact across the decode pipeline |
| `semantic_threshold` | `f64` | `0.7` | `detection_semantic_threshold`: per-attack-type semantic threats fire at or above this probability |
| `threat_score_threshold` | `f64` | `1.0` | `detection_threat_score_threshold`: the regex-anomaly weight sum at or above which the verdict is a threat |

## Scoring semantics

`is_threat` is `sum(regex weights) >= threat_score_threshold` or any semantic
threat. `threat_score` is `min(max(regex anomaly, semantic max), 1.0)` when
any threat exists, else `0.0`. Semantic threats are emitted per attack type
at or above `semantic_threshold`, with a `suspicious` fallback carrying the
overall score when no individual type crosses the line.

## Request contexts

`detect(content, request_context, config)` normalizes the context (the part
before the first `:`) to one of `query_param`, `header`, `url_path`,
`request_body`, or `unknown`. Unknown contexts relax the pattern view
filters; embedded-JSON leaf contexts (a `:embedded_json` suffix) keep the
suffix for validator scoping.

## The tower stage (guard_core_rs::tower)

The facade crate carries the first pipeline stage: a `tower::Layer`
(`RateLimitStageLayer`) for Axum/tonic-shaped stacks that wires the stateful
modules above into one request pass, mirroring the reference pipeline's
behavior for the two checks the stage owns (`rate_limit`, the ban check of
`ip_security`, and the detection feed of `suspicious_activity`):

| Request state | Decision |
|---|---|
| no client IP | pass through |
| banned (no exemption skip) | `403 "IP address banned"` |
| over the rate limit (skipped for `is_whitelisted \|\| is_exempt`) | `429 "Too many requests"` + `Retry-After: <window>` |
| detection finding crosses a ban threshold (skipped for whitelisted, never exempt) | `403 "IP has been banned"` |
| everything else | pass through |

- The client IP comes from the `SocketAddr` request extension (the peer
  address), falling back to the leftmost `x-forwarded-for` entry, then
  `x-real-ip`; a custom extractor replaces the default policy.
- The skip state is an `IpGateDecision` request extension, exactly what the
  global IP gate leaves behind; bans and detection still apply to an exempt
  IP.
- A crossing feeds `register_violations` with the `rate_limit`
  pseudo-category (reason `rate_limit_exceeded`) when
  `enable_rate_limit_auto_ban` is on; the `429` still goes out and the ban
  answers the next request, as in the reference.
- A `ThreatFinding` request extension (what a prior detection stage
  inserts) feeds the same engine with its categories (reason
  `penetration_attempt`); the crossing request itself is answered with the
  403 crossing-ban shape.
- The stage config is the pair of stateful configs above
  (`RateLimitStageConfig { rate_limit, ip_ban }`); construction fails
  closed on any invalid part (rate limit bounds, trusted-proxy entries,
  ban-config validation).
- Not yet mirrored: the endpoint-rate-limit tier (`endpoint_rate_limits`,
  route decorators, geo tiers; the stage runs the global per-IP window,
  the reference default tier), the reference's `passive_mode` (no
  counterpart in the Rust config surface yet), and the suspicious-activity
  `400` answer for a threat below the ban threshold (the detection stage
  has no tower counterpart yet).

## What is not implemented (fail-closed honesty)

The port targets spec 4.0.2 and is not complete. Do not expect these yet:

- **The 4.x pattern-table scan stage**: the full reference regex table
  across all scan views has no Rust counterpart yet; the corpus xfail
  baseline records the resulting divergences (the dominant cause of xfail
  entries).
- **Config, pipeline, and handler sections** (Python sections 02, 03,
  07-12): no `SecurityConfig`, no middleware protocol, no handlers,
  protocols, or decorators. The global IP gate (`whitelist`, `blacklist`,
  `exempt_ips`) exists (`ip_gate`), the in-memory rate limiter and dynamic
  IP ban store exist (`rate_limit`, `ip_ban`), and the rate-limit/ban
  pipeline stage exists for tower stacks (`guard_core_rs::tower`), but there
  is no Redis-backed distributed mode, no cloud provider blocking, no
  user-agent filtering, and no response factory; actix/rocket stages and
  the remaining pipeline stages live in the framework adapters.
- **`PerformanceMonitor`** and per-scan timeouts, plus a handful of tracked
  detection knobs recorded as unmapped with reasons.

## Conformance knobs

The conformance harness maps the five `DetectConfig` fields above from the
corpus `config_knobs` and records every unmapped knob with a reason. Changing
engine behavior requires the ledger or xfail baseline to stay consistent:
the gate fails on unbaselined failures, stale xfails, and not-run corpus
cases alike.
