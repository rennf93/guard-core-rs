# guard-core-rs

`guard-core-rs` is the Rust port of the
[guard-core](https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core) detection engine: the
framework-agnostic, CPU-bound core of the Guard ecosystem. It is a cargo
workspace that currently implements content preprocessing, semantic analysis,
and regex pattern detection, plus a spec 4.0.2 conformance harness.

It is a pre-1.0 work in progress: the 4.x pattern-table scan stage and all
I/O layers are not yet ported, and parity with the Python engine is partial
(the conformance gate reports the exact pass/xfail split on every run).

## What it provides

- Content preprocessing: unicode NFKC normalization with lookalike folding,
  a 7-round decoding pipeline (URL decoding, HTML entities, `\xNN`, `\uNNNN`,
  base64 candidates, SQL comment stripping), null-byte removal, and
  attack-preserving truncation
- Semantic analysis: token extraction, Shannon entropy, encoding layer
  detection, attack probability scoring, obfuscation detection, code
  injection risk, and aggregate threat scoring
- Regex pattern compilation with LRU caching and ReDoS safety validation
- The `detect` pipeline: the spec 4.0.2 `SusPatternsManager.detect`
  equivalent, with reference view passes and scoring semantics
- A conformance harness pinning behavior against the vendored spec 4.0.2
  corpus (163 cases across 11 suites)

## Ecosystem position

```text

```

The engine is pure, synchronous, and I/O-free: no network, no filesystem, no
tokio, no framework crates. Framework integration happens in the adapter
repositories above; each adapter translates native request content into
engine inputs, runs `detect`, and translates a threat verdict into a native
block response. The `examples/` directory shows that wiring over hyper.

## Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `guard-core-rs` | Facade crate (published name): re-exports the engine modules |
| `guard-core-engine` | The detection engine itself |
| `guard-core-python` | PyO3 bindings exposing the detection sections to Python |
| `guard-core-conformance` | Conformance gate, pattern ledger, xfail baseline |
| `guard-core-benchmark` | Criterion benches |

## Installation

The crate is not on crates.io yet. Depend on it via git:

```toml
[dependencies]
guard-core-rs = { git = "https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core-rs" }
```

Requires Rust 1.92 or later (edition 2024).

## Quick start

```rust
use guard_core_rs::detect::{self, DetectConfig};

let config = DetectConfig {
    max_content_length: 10_000,
    max_full_scan_bytes: 262_144,
    preserve_attack_patterns: true,
    semantic_threshold: 0.7,
    threat_score_threshold: 1.0,
};

let verdict = detect::detect("<script>alert(1)</script>", "query_param", &config);
assert!(verdict.is_threat);
```

## Next steps

- [Usage](usage.md) - the detection pipeline, contexts, and verdict shape
- [Configuration](configuration.md) - every `DetectConfig` knob, and what the
  engine does not implement yet
